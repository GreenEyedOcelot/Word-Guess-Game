# Word-Guess-Game
This is a Word Guess game, which is like Hangman, but without the picture of a hanging guy.

The theme of this game is "cognitive science", which is the interdisciplinary study of the mind, and utilizes psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.

Some of these terms and people are pretty obscure, so for TA testing purposes, the secret word(s) can be viewed in the Chrome console while the game is in session.

Here are some features that I added above and beyond the given specifications:
1. If the user clicks any key that is not a letter, nothing will happen.
2. There are different sounds played for winning or losing a game.
3. There are also different sounds played for guessing a right letter vs. a wrong letter.
4. When the game is won or lost, a message pops up for 5 seconds in red informing the user they have won or lost, before the game auto-restarts.
5. An image related to Cognitive Science has been added to the page.
6. I wasn't sure how to get the styling to relate to Cognitive Science specifically, but I did take care to make it look professional.

I tested this game thoroughly and believe it matches all of the given specifications, I hope I am correct.
